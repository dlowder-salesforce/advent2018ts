# Typescript solutions for Advent of Code 2018

I'm learning Typescript by using it to solve the coding puzzles in [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)!

Instructions:

- Clone this repo
- `yarn` or `npm install` to add the dependencies
- `yarn start` or `npm start` solves the puzzles for all the days I've completed so far
- `yarn test` or `npm test` runs Jest tests
